EVENT FROM CHATGPT MAKER OPENAI 
TODAY.
SET TO KICK OFF IN ABOUT AN 
HOUR
A DAY BEFORE GOOGLE IO DEVELOPER
EVENT.
DEIRDRE BOSA HAS MORE ON WHAT TO
EXPECT AND THE IMPACT ON TECH 
GIANTS THIS WEEK
>> HEY, GOOD MORNING, CARL
OPENAI NOW HAS THE POTENTIAL TO 
UPSTAGE GOOGLE JUST ONE DAY 
BEFORE THAT ALL-IMPORTANT IO
DEVELOPERS EVENT TOMORROW.
RIGHT NOW GOOGLE SHARES, AS YOU 
ARE LOWER BY ABOUT 2% ON AN 
APPLE OPENING PARTNERSHIP 
REPORT
AND IN JUST OVER AN HOUR, 
PRODUCT EVENT WILL BE HAPPENING 
AND WE'LL FOLLOW THAT CLOSELY.
ONE OF GOOGLE'S MOST COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGES IN THE AI ARMS RACE
IS ITS DISTRIBUTION.
MORE THAN A BILLION USERS ACROSS
ITS PRODUCTS
AND IT HAS SIGNED 
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR DEALS TO
KEEP ITS PLACEMENT ON APPLE 
DEVICES.
SO A REPORT THAT APPLE IS 
CLOSING IN ON A DEAL WITH OpenAI
TO PUT ChatGPT ON ITS iPHONES,
NOT A GOOGLE PRODUCT, THAT IS IN
THE WORLDS OF ONE NOTE THIS 
MORNING A TERRIBLE HEADLINE FOR 
GOOGLE
IT WOULD GIVE OpenAI THE THING
THAT IT IS MACEISSING, SCALE.
AND MORE WEIGHT TO WHATEVER IT
WILL ANNOUNCE IN ABOUT AN HOUR
ALTMAN POSTED THAT IT WON'T BE
ChatGPT 5, IT WON'T BE A SEARCH 
ENGINE, BUT IT WILL BE NEW STUFF
THAT THEY THINK PEOPLE WILL 
LOVE
ONE POSSIBILITY IS A MULTIMODAL 
AI VOICE ASSISTANT
LAST WEEK SAM ALTMAN TALKED 
ABOUT TWO APPROACHES, ONE AN AI 
AGENT THAT IS AN EXTENSION OF 
THE USER
AND CAN ANSWER Emails ON ITS
OWN.
OTHER WAS AN AI SENIOR EMPLOYEE 
THAT HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
USER THAT TRUSTED SENIOR
EMPLOYEE WOULD HAVE WITH THE CEO
THAT CAN PUSH BACK AND REASON.
ALTMAN PREFERRED THE LATTER.
ANOTHER IS BUILT IN PHONE CALL
CAPABILITY
AND THIS IS ALL AHEAD OF GOIN
E
GOOGLE IO TOMORROW
I'LL BE THERE IN PERSON IN
MOUNTA
