waren Buffett recently sold over 100
million in Apple shares of course I have
my own process that I follow but when he
sells that many shares you do have to
look at reasons why in the annual
meeting they were like well because for
tax reasons right taxes could go up
which I think was a brilliant answer to
tell Tim Cook here's why I'm offloading
my shares tax incentives are more
conducive this year than they will next
year okay the real answer is sentiment
is changing Apple's like almost in a
drake moment where it's like what Drake
M said people don't love you like that
like some of the love for apple is going
away
