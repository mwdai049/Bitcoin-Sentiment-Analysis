TO TALK ALL ABOUT WHAT WAS 
ANNOUNCED. 
>> WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DEIRDRE.
WHERE DID I LAST SEE A GUY IN A 
LIME GREEN JACKET, SITTING RIGHT
ACROSS FROM ME, BY THE WAY.
WED BUSH'S DAN IVES WITH US NOW.
>> IT WAS AHEAD OF THE 
PRESENTATION. 
>> AHEAD OF THE EVENT.
REALLY GOOD.
YOU SAY THERE IS AN AI ARMS RACE
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
WE KNOW WHO THE PLAYERS ARE.
HOW IS GOOGLE POSITIONED?
AND HOW IS IT DOING?
>> I THINK QUICKLY NARROWING THE
GAP VERSUS MICROSOFT AND OPEN 
AI.
BUT THIS IS A HUGE EVENT.
I MEAN FOR DEVELOPERS IN TERMS 
OF THIS GAME OF THRONES THAT'S 
PLAYING OUT.
GOOGLE REALLY NEEDS TO SHOW FROM
A GEMINI PERSPECTIVE AND FROM AI
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE 
ONES THAT ACTUALLY MONETIZE 
THIS.
AT THE SAME TIME, THAT IT LOOKS 
LIKE APPLE AND OPEN AI ARE GOING
TO HAVE THE PARTNERSHIP.
DEIRDRE TALKS ABOUT THE DEVICE.
WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE AI 
DEVICE.
WE THINK IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE
THE FUTURE OF THE iPHONE.
I THINK iPHONE 16, WWDC NEXT 
MONTH.
SO THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE -- I 
THINK THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB 
TO SHOW SEARCH AS WELL AS EVEN 
ON CLOUD, WHEN YOU THINK AI, YOU
DON'T JUST THINK MICROSOFT AND 
THE GOD FATHER OF AI, NVIDIA, 
YOU THINK GOOGLE. 
>> IS THE FUTURE OF THEIR AI, 
JUST AS YOU SAID, THE FUTURE FOR
APPLE, IS THE iPHONE, AI IN 
APPLE.
IS THE iPHONE.
IS THE FUTURE HERE THE ANDROID 
PHONE?
>> SO, I THINK IT'S REALLY -- 
IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT SEARCH, 
HOW THEY MONETIZE THAT IN TERMS 
OF WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOU LOOK 
AT GEMINI, YOU LOOK AT SORT OF 
THESE NEXT VERSIONS, HOW ARE 
THEY GOING TO MONETIZE THAT?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE 
ACTUAL ADVERTISERS.
OF COURSE THEY'LL BE ADVERTISING
AI FROM A CLOUD PERSPECTIVE.
THAT'S A HUGE PIECE OF GOOGLE AS
WELL.
AFTER A LOT OF BLACK EYES THAT 
THEY'VE HAD FROM GEMINI, FROM 
SOME OF THE LAUNCHES, IT'S 
IMPORTANT HERE TO DEVELOPERS 
THAT THEY FLEX THE MUSCLE AND 
SHOW WE HAVE THE PRODUCT.
WE HAVE SOMETHING OTHERS DON'T 
HAVE.
AND I THINK THIS SO FAR HAS 
BEEN -- 
>> WE HAVE THE MEATS.
>> BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
LAST 6 TO 12 MONTHS, IT HASN'T.
IT'S EXCUSES.
WELL THIS.
WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS.
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT EVENT TO 
SHOW THEY'RE LEADING AGAIN.
WHEN IT COMES TO SUEARCH, IT 
CONTINUES TO BE THEIR WORLD, 
EVERYONE ELSE IS PAYING RENT.
>> YOU LOOK AT NADELLA AND 
OBVIOUSLY APPLE AND COOK, THIS 
WILL BE A REALLY BATTLE THAT 
PLAYS OUT GOING AFTER THAT 
TRILLION DOLLAR SPEND. 
>> IF SIRI BECOMES POWERED BY 
CHATGPT I WOULD DEFAULT TO USING
THAT ALL THE TIME.
WHAT'S GOOGLE'S ANSWER TO THAT?
>> I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE THAT 
ANSWER YET.
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A SEARCH 
ASSISTANT AND WHAT THAT COULD 
BE.
BUT THE NIGHTMARE FOR GOOGLE, 
WHAT KEEPS SINDAR UP AT NIGHT, 
IT'S COOK GETTING TOGETHER.
THEY LAUNCH, THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR
GOOGLE.
THEY WANTED TO BE FRONT AND 
CENTER IN TERMS OF GEMINI.
AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT 
DYNAMIC THAT'S PLAYING OUT HERE 
WHO IS GOING TO MONETIZE. 
>> MAYBE IN FAIRNESS TO THEM, 
GOOGLE MIGHT ARGUE IT HAS THE 
BETTER POSITION WITH ENTERPRISE 
WITH ITS TOOLS IN THE CLOUD, 
RELIABILITY, CAPABILITY, SIMPLE 
SCALE BUT WITH THE CONSUMER, IF 
THIS VOICE USAGE DISRUPTS ME 
GOING TO GOOGLE, I DON'T KNOW 
HOW GOOGLE CAN ANSWER THAT. 
>> AND I THINK THAT IS THE 
BIGGEST CHALLENGE.
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE REALLY 
TRYING TO SHOWCASE TODAY THAT 
THIS TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE 
SO GOOD THAT YOUR NOT GOING TO 
BYPASS THAT.
YOU'LL HEAR NEXT MONTH FROM COOK
IN TERMS OF THIS OPEN AI 
PARTNERSHIP AND WHAT ULTIMATELY 
WILL BE THE iPHONE 16 AND I 
THINK WHOLE AI STRATEGY FROM 
APPLE, THEY'RE BETTING ON OPEN 
AI. 
>> HOW IRONIC IS IT, GIVEN THE 
HISTORY BETWEEN APPLE AND 
MICROSOFT THAT IT IS NOW APPLE 
AND MICROSOFT BONDING IN EFFECT,
POTENTIALLY, BONDING TO FEND OFF
OR TO GET COMPETITIVE STRENGTH 
AGAINST OTHER RIVALS?
>> IT'S AN ALFRED HITCHCOCK -- 
NO ONE WOULD EVER EXPECT YOU 
WOULD GET TO THIS POINT.
BUT IT COMES DOWN TO WHO HAS THE
BEST TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE.
IT'S ALL IN OPEN AI.
THAT'S WHY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT 
EVENT FOR GOOGLE SHOWING WHERE 
THEY'RE GOING.
BUT THIS IS ONE GET OUT THE 
POPCORN.
THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE TO BE 
WRITTEN. 
>> LOVE IT.
AND LOVE THE GREEN JACKE
