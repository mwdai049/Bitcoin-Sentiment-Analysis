let's say I gave you $1,000 and with
this $1,000 I gave you the ability to
invest between two options $1,000 in
Bitcoin or $1,000 in Apple stock which
one are you taking and
why uh good question um I guess I would
take the Apple stock because I feel like
it I know more about it and so it would
just be like the most obvious answer for
me is that the wrong answer no that's
the right answer whatever answer do you
have any thoughts about cryptocurrency
in general like what's the first
thoughts to come to mind I just know
nothing about it like at all like I am
the wrong person to ask I wish I knew
more okay definitely I just appreciate
the honest feedback thank of course of
course have a good day
