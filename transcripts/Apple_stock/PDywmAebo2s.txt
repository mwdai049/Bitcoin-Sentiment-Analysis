my dad bought the original iPhone back
in 2007 for $500 I was just wondering if
he had invested the same amount in Apple
stocks back then how much would he have
by now interesting so in 2007 the Apple
stock price was $3 today the price is
$165 if you invested $500 back in the
day he would have made $27,500 today
that's equivalent to 27 iPhone 15s
pretty good in my book start investing
with multibank Plus
