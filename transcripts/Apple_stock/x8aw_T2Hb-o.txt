NOT BECAUSE OF JAY POWELL.
NOT BECAUSE OF ANYTHING ELSE.
THESE COMPANIES ARE INCREDIBLY 
PROFITABLE.
>> ONE OF THE REASONS YOU'RE 
HERE, I GUESS, STEPHANIE LINK, 
IS FROM THE APRIL LOWS, THE 
CLOSE ON APRIL 19th, TECHNOLOGY 
IS THE BEST PERFORMING SECTOR.
JUST AS PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO 
WRITE IT OFF.
THE BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND IT.
REVENUE GROWTH IS DEAD.
LATE ON A.I., ET CETERA, ET 
CETERA.
THE STOCK IS UP TODAY.
WE'LL CALL IT 190.
AND YOU BOUGHT MORE OF IT.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GETTING TO.
THAT'S OUR HEADLINE, YOU'RE MORE
OVERWEIGHT YOUR BIGGEST POSITION
NOW OVERALL IS APPLE.
TELL US.
>> IT'S ABOUT 7%, THE S&P 500 
WEIGHTING IS ABOUT 6.5%.
IT'S A VERY BIG POSITION FOR ME.
EVEN THOUGH IT'S HAD A NICE 
BOUNCE IT'S DOWN 5% FROM ITS 
HIGHS, AND I THINK WE KNOW ALL 
OF THE NEGATIVE STUFF OUT THERE 
IN TERMS OF TOP LINE BEING 
SLUGGISH AND CHINA BEING A 
PROBLEM.
I THINK, THOUGH, THAT THE 
SERVICES BUSINESS IS JUST A 
JUGGERNAUT, AND WHAT IS EXCITING
IS IT IS NOW 26% OF TOTAL 
REVENUES UP FROM 16% 
SEQUENTIALLY, AND IT'S GROWING 
14, 15%, AND I THINK IT WILL 
CONTINUE TO GROW DOUBLE DIGITS.
I THINK, ALSO, IN THE 10Q WHEN I
WAS GOING THROUGH IT, OPERATING 
MARGINS WERE UP IN EVERY SINGLE 
REGION OF THE WORLD OTHER THAN 
CHINA.
THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.
I THOUGHT THEIR GROSS MARGIN 
STORY HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING.
THEY'RE BUYING BACK A TON OF 
STOCK, RAISED THE DIVIDEND, AND 
YOU HAVE WWDC IN JUNE, YOU HAVE 
AN iPHONE 16 CYCLE COME UP.
WE HAVE A LOT OF A.I. TO LOOK 
FORWARD TO IN TERMS OF THE 
CYCLE.
I WANTED TO MAKE IT BIGGER.
IT'S NOT CHEAP, AND SOAP I THINK
THERE'S SOME VALUE HERE.
>> IT WAS THAT RECORD BUYBACK 
THEY ANNOUNCED, WHICH SEEMED 
REALLY TO JUMP-START THE STOCK 
AGAIN.
AND, IF NOTHING ELSE, REMINDED 
PEOPLE OF THE ENGINE THAT THEY 
HAVE OF THE BUYBACKS BECAUSE THE
MOUNTAIN OF MONEY THEY SIT ON 
AND ALL OF THIS DOESN'T TAKE 
INTO ACCOUNT WHAT MAY HAPPEN AT 
WWDC WHERE WE GET MORE CLARITY 
ON A.I.
YOU ADDED TO IT A COUPLE WEEKS 
AGO.
>> WE DID.
WAS IT $110 BILLION BUYBACK.
I LIKE BUYING THINGS OUT OF 
FAVOR.
I LIKE THIS MOVE BY STEPH AND 
CONTINUE TO ADD TO IT ON HER 
END.
IT'S A SLIGHT BIT UNDERWEIGHT 
FOR US AGAINST THE S&P 500, BUT 
IT'S IN THE TOP FIVE OR TOP SIX 
WHERE WE ARE ALL HEAVY TECH 
AMAZON, ALPHABET, MICRON, 
NVIDIA, SYNOPSIS AND APPLE, ALL 
IN THERE.
AND HERE IS THE THING ABOUT 
APPLE IS THEY HAVEN'T SPENT AS 
MUCH ON A.I. JUST YET.
JOSH, YOU SAID IT.
APPLE DOESN'T COME FIRST, BUT 
THEY COME RIGHT.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN SOME TAIL WINDS 
AS THEY START TO SPEND ON A.I.
THESE CONDITIONS ARE INVESTING 
IN THE FUTURE AND THERE IS THIS 
INNOVATION TO DRIVE THE GROWTH.
>> APPLE WAS IN A 17% DRAWDOWN 
FROM ITS HIGHS AS RECENTLY AS 
APRIL 19th AND THE NARRATIVE IS 
THIS BLUE CHIP STOCK WILL GO 
INTO ITS OWN BEAR MARKET.
REMEMBER HOW QUICKLY NARRATIVES 
CAN COME AND CAN FADE AWAY AND 
GO.
JUST SENTIMENT, THERE'S NO 
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE.
APPLE IS STILL THE WORST 
PERFORMER YEAR TO DATE EVEN WITH
THE RECENT RALLY.
IT'S THE THIRD WORST PERFORMER 
YEAR TO DATE BEHIND TESLA AND 
J&J.
NEGATIVE 1%
