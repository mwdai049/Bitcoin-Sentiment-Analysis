BLOOMBERG REPORTING PUTTING 
CHATGPT FEATURES FROM OPENAI ON 
ITS NEXT OPERATING SYSTEM.
APPLE EXPECTED TO SHOWCASE NEW
A.I. CAPABILITIES AT AN EVENT 
NEXT MONTH
SEPARATELY TWO LABOR-RELATED
STORIES.
FIRST WORK IS AT A MARYLAND 
STORE VOTING TO AUTHORIZE A 
STRIKE
SECOND, BLOOMBERG SAYS THAT 
EMPLOYEES AT THE SHORT HILLS
MALL, IN NEW JERSEY AREA, HIT 
THAT APPLE STORE, VOTED AGAINST 
UNIONIZING
JOINING US NOW ON ALL THE 
HEADLINES, TONI SACCONAGHI, 
BERNSTEIN SENIOR RESEARCH 
ANALYST.
YOU POSITIVE ON THE STOCK RIGHT 
NOW, TONI?
>> GOOD MORNING, JOE
YES.
WE ARE POSITIVE ON THE STOCK
WE UPGRADED OR RATING A COUPLE
WEEKS AGO AND THINK RISK/REWARD 
ON THE NAME IIS ATTRACTIVE AT
CURRENT LEVELS. 
>> AND IS THIS, COMPARED TO WHAT
QUEER TALKING ABOUT AND OTHER 
STUFF WE'LL TOUCH ON MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT OR SOMETHING TO WATCH?
>> I THINK LABOR IS RELATIVELY
DE
DOUG
DE MINIMIS
IT HAPPENING AT APPLE STORES
LESS THAN 10% ON A GLOBAL BASIS 
AND CERTAINLY LESS THAN THAT IN 
THE U.S.
CLEARLY THERE COULD BE
INCREMENTAL COSTS ASSOCIATED IF 
UNION ACTIVITY WAS ORGANIZED
OVER TIME BUT IT'S NOT MATERIAL 
IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS 
FOR APPLE.
>> TELL ME ABOUT APPLE AND A.I.?
ALMOST REMINDS ME OF MUSICAL
CHAIRS
WHO ARE THE FRENEMIES?
HOW IS IT YOU ALL GOING TO PLAY 
OUT?
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE STRATEGY
WILL EVENTUALLY BE ORCAN ANYON
KNOW AT THIS POINT
>> WELL, I THINK THE IMPORTANT
THING TO RECOGNIZE ABOUT APPLE
IS, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO THIS
ITSELF
THERE'S BEEN SORT OF THIS 
CRITICISM BY INVESTORS THAT 
APPLE IS NOT SPENDING ENOUGH ON 
A.I. OR IT'S BEHIND IN A.I
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO
KNOW THAT THERE MAY BE SOME 
ELEMENTS OF A.I. THAT APPLE WILL
UNDERTAKE ITSELF
AND THERE WILL BE SOME ELEMENTS 
OF A.I. THAT APPLE WILL LOOK TO 
PARTNER WITH, AND I THINK WE CAN
SEE THAT TODAY WITH APPLE IN THE
SENSE THAT IT DRIVES A
SIGNI
SIGNIFICANT PERCENT OF ITS
PROFITS PROBABLY 25% OR MORE
FROM PROFITS PROVIDING ACCESS TO
SEARCH FOR GOOGLE AND GOOGLE
BEING THE DEFAULT SEARCH ENGINE 
AND FROM ITS APP STORE
IN BOTH COUNTRIES GOOGLE IS 
DOING AND CREATING THE SEARCH 
ENGINE
IN THE APP STORE THE MILLIONS OF
APP DEVELOPERS PUTTING THEIR
BLOOD, WET AND TEARS IN, AND
APPLE COLLECTS EFFECTIVELY A
TOOL FOR ACCESS TO ITS CUSTOMER 
BASE
IT'S INCREDIBLY LUCRATIVE.
THE SAME THING COULD HAPPEN IN
A.I.
>> TONI, THAT'S THE QUESTION
DO YOU IMAGINE THAT WHEN WE HEAR
A DEAL, IF THERE IS ONE STRUCK, 
BETWEEN OPENAI YOU HEAR ABOUT 
THAT, THAT OPENAI IS PAYING 
APPLE AS OPPOSED TO APPLE PAYING
THEM
>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION
AI MODELS TODAY ARE JUST
STARTING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO 
MONETIZE, MUCH LIKE SEARCH
INITIALLY WAS LOOKING FOR WAYS
TO MONETIZE ITSELF
OVER TIME CERTAINLY, IF APPLE IS
PROVIDING ACCESS TO 1.12 BILLION
iPHONE USERS AS A DEFAULT OR
PARTNER WITH SOMEONE AND THEY'RE
PAYING SIGNIFICANT MONEY, 
THEY'LL BE PAYING APPLE SOME
KIND OF REVENUE SHARE.
INITIALLY THAT MAY NOT BE THE 
CASE. 
>> DO YOU IMAGINE THAT OPENAI 
THAT CURRENTLY RUNS ON AZURE
THAT EFFECTIVELY, THIS DEAL, IF 
THERE IS A DEAL TO BE DONE, THAT
OPENAI's TECHNOLOGY WILL RUN
LITERALLY PHYSICALLY ON DEVICE
I DON'T THINK IT CAN RUN ON 
DEVICE
IF IT DOESN'T RUN ON DEVICE, IS 
IT GOING TO RUN ON AN APPLE 
SERVER SOMEWHERE OR MICROSOFT 
SERVER SOMEWHERE, IN WHICH
INDICATION MICROSOFT IS GOING TO
BE COLLECTING REVENUE SOMEHOW?
>> WE DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS
I THINK WE DO KNOW IN ALL 
LIKELIHOOD IF THERE IS A
PARTNERSHIP, A LOT OF THE SEARCH
WILL BE RUNNING OFF A DEVICE
IT WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH DATA 
CENTERS, WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH 
A MICROSOFT DATA CENTER.
IT'S CERTAINLY PLAUSIBLE THAT 
COULD BE THE CASE GOING FORWARD.
SO, YES, THAT IS A POSSIBILITY. 
>> AND THEN HOW DO YOU -- I 
THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE 
ALL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,S IF 
THERE'S A DEAL WITH OPENAI, DOES
THAT MEAN THERE'S NOT A DEAL
WITH GOOGLE OR GOOGLE'S GEMINI
OR SOMEBODY SE, OR DO YOU 
THINK THAT'S A MIX-AND-MATCH
PATCHWORK?
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE 
CASE
WHAT WE BELIEVE APPLE HAS BEEN
WORKING ON IN PART IS IMPROVING 
THE FRONT INTO SIRI.
SIRI IS THE ACCESS POINT TO 
OPENAI ENGINES
APPLE IS WORKING TO MAKE SIRI 
MORE INTEL JNLT.
AND THEY COULD SAY, THIS KIND OF
QUERY IS GOING TO OPEN IOWA.
THIS KIND OF QUERREY WILL GO TO 
A VOICE TO IMAGE OR VOICE TO
VIDEO, GENERAL AI GOING FORWARD.
CERTAINLY THERE COULD BE A FRONT
END IN PLACE THAT DECIDES WHERE 
A USER QUERREY SHOULD GO TO,
WHICH AI ENGINE OR APP GOING
FORWARD.
IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE APPLE 
COULD HAVE DEALS WITH MORE THAN 
ONE PARTNER.
>> YOU THINK IT'S BACK IN THE 
WEAK HANDS
I WOULDN'T CALL WARREN BUFFETT
WEAK HANDS
DO YOU THINK ANYTHING THAT WOULD
BE DONE TO WRING OUT COMPLACENCY
HAS GONE ONWARD AND UPWARD WITH 
APPLE?
>> APPLE HAS GONE UP YEAR TO
DATE
THERE'S BEEN A WEAK CYCLE, SO 
PART OF THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF 
APPLE IS THAT IT'S TRADING BELOW
ITS THREE- AND FIVE-YEAR
AVERAGES, AND SO THAT PROVIDES A
MORE ATTRACTIVE ENTRY POINT.
OUR BELIEF IS APPLE IS A REALLY 
POWERFUL FRANCHISE AND NOW YOU
HAVE A MORE ATTRACTIVE PRICE TO 
BUY IT AT.
I THINK AI COULD CERTAINLY BE A 
CATALYST FOR THE NAME OVER THE
NEXT THREE OR FOUR MONTHS IN THE
INTRODUCTION OF THE iPHONE 1
