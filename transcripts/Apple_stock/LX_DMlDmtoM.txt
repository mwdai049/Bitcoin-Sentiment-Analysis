All right.
On this day, May 15, 2001, Apple began a
major shift in how the company connected
with its customer.
Steve Jobs on that day publicly provided
details of plans to sell Mac computers
directly through Apple owned retail
stores.
It was an expansion away from a sales
strategy that had up to then been
heavily reliant on third party retailers
like Circuit City, Sears and CompUSA.
But legend has it that Jobs was
frustrated with the retail partnerships
and what he viewed as inadequate
visibility of Apple products inside
those stores and staff members that
weren't experienced enough or
enthusiastic enough to showcase the
technology.
At the time, Apple only had less than 3%
of the US computer market, and Jobs said
that the company's own research showed
the other 95% didn't even give Apple
products a second thought.
Jobs even griped that the Macworld trade
show in January of that year that quote,
Buying a car is no longer the worst
purchasing experience.
Buying a computer is number one.
Of course, that somewhat audacious
comment, an even more audacious solution
for Apple to have its own retail
footprint, was met with quite a few
raised eyebrows.
Competing computer maker Gateway had
already embarked on a similar brick and
mortar strategy that ultimately
struggled under the high overhead
expenses, inventory levels and
logistical needs to maintain a
nationwide retail network.
And a lot of the electronic superstores
that Apple was partnering with.
They were struggling with the breakdown
in their business models.
CompUSA, Circuit City.
Go find one now.
But as we know, Steve Jobs was not one
to be denied.
For at least two years prior to that
announcement, Jobs had already been
working quietly with current and former
executives from the Gap, Target and
Victoria's Secret to help make this
retail strategy a reality.
And that brings us to our Question of
the Day.
Where were the first two Apple stores
located?
The answer in the posh Washington, D.C.,
suburb of McLean, Virginia, and in the
Los Angeles suburb of Glendale,
California.
It started with two.
Those stores, which opened four days
after the May 15th announcement, were
cavernous.
Despite the fact that Apple only had
four product lines at the time,
remember, this was six years before the
iPhone era even began and nine years
before the introduction of the iPad.
So the stores were pretty much just
range around Mac computers in the front
quarter of the store with the rest of
the square footage devoted to software
accessories and then services like that
theater for educational programs or the
Genius Bar, which you can get your
computer repaired.
In May of that year, Bloomberg
Businessweek published a headline that
said, Sorry, Steve, here's why Apple
Stores won't work.
Now, that article proved to be terribly
misguided in hindsight, focusing heavily
on sales.
But ultimately, the stores were much
more about the presentation of Apple
products rather than the hard sell
itself.
In fact, Steve Jobs said that himself.
He said the product was not the most
important thing here.
And that may be why the stores proved so
successful.
They were stylish with comfortable,
minimalist surroundings on the inside
and creative architecture on the outside
that was less brick and mortar and more
glass and sandstone.
It was all part of an aesthetic, a vibe
that crafted an image of a company that
was selling a lifestyle, selling an
ethos, selling street cred, if you will.
And it was an image that fueled the
growth to more than 500 stores today.
And it has fueled sales growth at that
company for 23 years and counting.
