apple or Tesla what would you buy I just
told you I don't invest in the stock
market but in companies in business I
would invest in either of them either of
them no cuz I don't get my money back I
want my money back
[Music]
okay gold or
Bitcoin
gold fight or
flight that's that's a stupid questions
I'm sometimes people that fight lose so
what what what's wrong with losing okay
question what you've been taught and you
ask me superficial questions rather than
why wouldn't I invest in Apple or
Tesla see that's a more important
question that's an open question you can
do what but why wouldn't I invest in
them because you don't get your money
back
yes I'm starting to learn yes I can make
money much faster than Apple or Tesla
and I would use debt I wouldn't use my
money but do you think
