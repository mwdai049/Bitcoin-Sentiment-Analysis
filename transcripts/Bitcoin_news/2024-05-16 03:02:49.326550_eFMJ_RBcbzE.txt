7% ON WEDNESDAY HAVING ITS BEST 
DAY SINCE MARCH 25th.
CRYPTOCURRENCY TAKING OFF AFTER 
A COOLER THAN EXPECTED CPI

RIGHT NOW, BITCOIN IS STILL 
ABOVE 66.
JOINING US, ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, 
SKY BRIDGE CAPITAL FOUNDER AND 
MANAGING PARTNER.
HIS NEW BOOK IS "FROM WALL 
STREET TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
BACK" IT DOES GO OVER HIS 
EXPERIENCE AND IT IS FOUR PAGES.
IT IS A PAMPHLET BECAUSE IT -- 
>> YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF THE 
PAGES.
ALSO 954,000 SOMETIMES I SAY IT 
TO MY THERAPIST. 
>> EVERY SECOND WAS -- YOU COULD
PROBABLY WRITE DID EVERY -- 
>> 221 PAGES. 
>> 221 PAGES.
IS THERE -- IF I PAY HIM TO READ
IT, HE CHARGES ME FOR THE INDEX.
THERE IS NO INDEX. 
>> NO.
YOU CAN BUY IS ON AUDIBLE.
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP THE 
BOOK. 
>> ARE YOU -- DO YOU HAVE 
UPDATES ON THE INSTITUTIONAL 
ADOPTION OF BITCOIN?
I'VE SEEN SOME COMMENTS, 
EVERYTHING IS EVENTUALLY GOING 
TO BE ON LIGHTNING OR -- 
>> LIGHTNING NETWORK.
LISTEN, I THINK THE 
INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION IS 
HAPPENING NOW.
THE STATE OF WISCONSIN ANNOUNCED
WE EXPECT OTHER PENSION FUNDS TO
ANNOUNCE AND, OF COURSE, BITCOIN
NOW HAS THE REGULATORY APPROVAL 
AND I THINK THAT WAS THE RATE 
LIMITING STEP FOR A LOT OF THESE
LARGE SCALE INSTITUTIONS AND 
JUST REMEMBER, IF YOU'RE NOT 
LONG BITCOIN, YOU'RE POSSIBLY 
SHORT BITCOIN IN THE SENSE THAT 
IF YOU BELIEVE AND I THINK 
BLACKROCK IS MORE OR LESS SAID 
THIS, THIS WILL BE PART OF A 
LONG-TERM TACTICAL ASSET 
ALLOCATION STRATEGY FOR 
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS, THEN AT
SOME POINT YOU GOT TO GET LONG 
BITCOIN.
IS IT A PERCENT OF BITCOIN, 1.5%
BITCOIN?
I DON'T KNOW.
SO, A LOT OF SMART INSTITUTIONS 
ARE SAYING LET ME GET LONG THIS 
THING BEFORE IT BECOMES PART OF 
A TOTAL TACTICAL ASSET 
ALLOCATION INDEX.
THAT IS STARTING TO HAPPEN NOW 
AND THAT'S VERY GOOD FOR 
BITCOIN. 
>> IS IT BECAUSE IT IS A HEDGE 
AGAINST 34 TRILLION IN MONEY 
PRINTING OR WHATEVER IT IS?
OR IS IT GOING TO BE USED TO 
SEAMLESSLY TRANSACT AROUND THE 
WORLD?
OR BOTH?
>> I'M IN THE DIGITAL GOLD 
CATEGORY.
MICHAEL SALER, WILL SAY, NO, 
THIS IS IN THE UNIVERSAL 
CURRENCY CATEGORY, MEANING IT 
WILL EVENTUALLY BE THE 
STANDARDIZED CURRENCY FOR THE 
WORLD OVER THINGS LIKE THE 
LIGHTNING NETWORK.
BUT I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT 
FOR PEOPLE TO DO IS DO THE 
HOMEWORK ON BITCOIN.
WHEN YOU DO THE HOMEWORK ON 
BITCOIN, YOU GO TOWARD BITCOIN, 
I KNOW VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT HAVE
DONE THE HOMEWORK, YOU KNOW, 
SEVERAL HUNDRED HOURS OF 
UNDERSTANDING BITCOIN, NOT JUST 
READING THE RIGHT PAPER, BUT 
RALLY UNDERSTANDING THE HISTORY 
OF MONEY AND ALL THE DIFFERENT 
BOXES THAT BITCOIN CHECKS OFF.
>> THAT WAS A REVELATION. 
>> I HAVE BEEN IN TROUBLE ON 
THIS, BECAUSE I ANNOUNCED OUR --
WE ANNOUNCED SKY BRIDGE OUR 
BITCOIN POSITION IN NOVEMBER OF 
2020.
AND A LOT OF INSTITUTIONS, WIRE 
HOUSES, THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT, 
THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE POSITION, 
IT IS FOUR YEARS LATER, NOW 
THESE VERY SAME WIRE HOUSES ARE 
ADOPTING THE POSITION AND ARE 
GETTING LONG THE ETF OR ALLOWING
FINANCIAL ADVISERS TO RECOMMEND 
THE ETF.
SO, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES WHEN 
YOU'RE EARLY, YOU GET A LOT OF 
BUMPS AND SCRAPES, BUT IT PAYS 
TO BE EARLY IN BITCOIN AND I 
THINK WE'RE STILL EARLY IN 
BITCOIN. 
>> IF THEY'RE REALLY -- IF THERE
IS 21 MILLION AND IT IS GOING TO
EVENTUALLY HAVE A -- SOME 
PERCENTAGE OF WHAT THE GOLD 
MARKET IS, WHY -- IT SHOULD BE 
150 BY THE END OF THE YEAR, I 
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT 150,000 IS BY 
THE END OF THE YEAR, IF IT SEEMS
LIKE IF THAT'S A GIVEN, IT 
SHOULD BE MOVING UP EVEN MORE 
QUICKLY. 
>> LET'S JUST DO THE MATH.
LET'S SAY GOAL IS $16 TRILLION, 
LET'S SAY TOM LEE IS WRONG BY 
HALF, WHICH I DON'T THINK HE IS,
AND I APPRECIATE HIM COMING TO 
MY BOOK PARTY LAST NIGHT, I 
THINK TOM LEE IS GOING TO BE 
RIGHT.
BUT IF BITCOIN GOT TO $8 
TRILLION -- 
>> A COIFED TOM LEE OR WILD TOM 
LEE?
>> IT WAS WILD TOM LEE.
HE'S SO ZEN-LIKE, SO SMART.
DOESN'T HAVE YOUR OR MY 
EMOTIONAL WAVE LENGTH, JOE, YOU 
KNOW, WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO SI
