welcome back to another Sunday walk
video so
today I want to talk about something
strange that's going on with Bitcoin
something that I can't pinpoint at this
point in time so I kind of want to share
my two two cents about it um and then
we'll see if there's anything else I
want to share but yeah let's get to it
right now bitco
as I'm filming this I'm filming this a
little bit later um but it's still
beautiful out and you can see the
weather's out look at the scenery behind
me absolutely beautiful but as of right
now Bitcoin is stuck under 62,000 about
615 and the reason why this is strange
is it's pretty obvious and you could see
this in the
charts Bitcoin all of a
sudden like last week we saw this too
all of a sudden you would see B Point
dip down huge the volume the cell volume
kick in huge out of
nowhere so it's pretty obvious that
someone sold you know at that time
that's why you see this massive down
Wick right or down Candlestick for
Bitcoin and then afterwards what happens
is you see Bitcoin
slowly
slowly climbing back up and then all of
a sudden you see a another major down
right and that's what's troubling about
Bitcoin right now has been happening the
last few weeks in
fact yeah I would say the last few weeks
I mean if you go back a month ago
Bitcoin was still hovering in the high
60s we even touched upon 70 again then
we started trending down to about the
you know the the mid 60s and now we're
kind of hovering around the low 60 these
and you'll see this huge cell out of
nowhere and the reason why this is
troubling is because I can't identify
who's actually selling prior it was
pretty obvious that grayscale and their
massive selling had effect on the market
but
now grayscale outflow has basically
diminish and we even had days of inflow
into grayscale right and I saw the
numbers on Friday Friday we actually had
an
inflow so it's it's not the ETFs it's
not the institutions that are selling
the ETFs are still taking in more than
what they're selling and grayscale even
though there's been a few days where
they still had more sells than buys
overall now they're starting to take in
too we saw this
flippening that's why last week when I
did my Sunday walk video I'm like man
I'm very bullish about the upcoming week
because
grayscale For the First Time stopped
selling and actually bought and this
last
week we actually saw more inflows into
gray scale but unfortunately this last
week we didn't see a huge massive pump
we didn't see it uh increase because
we're seeing some unknown entity sell
off massive amount of Bitcoin and I've
been looking and looking and looking
it's not ETS it's not the miners there's
a lot of chart that show minor outflow
or netf
flow is about the same the miners are
not selling right now either so now
who's
selling right who who has enough Bitcoin
that's actually selling right now that
can actually disrupt bitcoin's upward
movement so there's only two that I
could come up with number one Mount gox
and number two f FX and FTX may be over
soon but FTX let's just start out with
that FTX they did say that everyone that
they ow money to basically will be
repaid not only that they're going to
pay them interest and the reason why
they're able to do this is because of
their big investment into an Tropic
which is AI company that AI that Amazon
bought out and number two whatever asset
they held went up in value so they're
not paying back an asset they're just
paying back in dollar amount that was
owed so they actually have more so
they're actually giving
out more than what they owe which is
quite interesting so they're adding on
interest so there's a possibility that
FTX is still trying to sell off right
now to make cash to pay people back but
I figure by now they would have done so
already we've been hearing about that
for over a year how they may be selling
to repay back creditors so I'm not so
sure if they're the ones doing that
right now I think they
already sold but who knows maybe they
didn't or they sold portions of it and
they are selling now because again if
they're go pay back people more than
what they owe that means the price of
crypto went up which means they probably
haven't sold yet and by the way look at
this see that little
[Applause]
guy and then his
family or her family
behind got
three three deers here just chilling
back on me that's pretty cool
um so it could be
FTX and I don't know if anyone is still
tracking their wallets I tried with
crypto Quan and I didn't see any
movement from FTS wallet so maybe
different wallets now so number one it
could be them or number two it could be
Mount gox so the latest is Mount gox has
to repay Everyone by October this year
that's what I'm hearing
so does that mean they are selling off
right now also to pay back people that
are you know getting getting whatever
they owed in cash because they're not
paying from what I'm
told I take that back some people have
asked for cash some people have asked
for Bitcoin right
so the people that ask for Bitcoin
obviously they're not will be selling
Mount Go's not selling ahead of time to
give it back to him so there may be a
chance that people that ask for cash
they're selling it for those
people I don't know we don't know the
breakdown how many ask for cash how many
ask for Bitcoin and some of the largest
creditors of Mount GX have said we're
not we're not selling we've been waiting
for what 10 years what's another few
years right they're going to wait for
the bull market to end before selling
so I like to think most people that have
been
waiting they're going to continue
waiting they're not going to sell
they're not going to panic sell right
now so yeah I don't I don't know if it's
m GX for for the people that have Ash to
be uh settled in
cash maybe they're selling out for them
those are the only two that I could
think of
honestly and I'm purely speculating on
this because I can't think of anyone
else Hong Kong their
ETFs you know are still buying Bitcoin
they have over 300 million which isn't
too bad after 2 weeks of being opened I
know a lot of people were disappointed
but overall it's just another way
another another
funnel for institutions and investors to
get in Bitcoin and
now a lot of those fun issuers they want
to issue them in mainland China
too if that happens watch out trillions
will be flowing in
because China has a policy right now
where all the rich they can't get their
money
out I think it's like 50,000 limit per
year everything else they can only
invest in what's
inhouse but imagine if a Bitcoin ETF was
available in China man
I can see trillions going into that in
the near future if that was allowed in
mainland China so that's something that
they're seeking I don't
know if it's going to be approved or not
so we'll see but yeah you know overall I
feel like that's what's going
on we have this incredible downward
pressure cell pressure from this one
entity that I can't
identify I really don't know really
don't know and I
think you know this is against some of
the this is against the I guess a thesis
from a lot of ta guys who are saying we
should be going down to
52 and it's going to be a boring summer
or it's going to be a down summer and
that's based on what has happened
previous times and previous
years I think it's more than that I
think maybe some of that is true
in fact I just had a live stream with
Noah was one of my analysts on Cru plus
yesterday cryptos R Us plus and he kind
of has the same thinking it's like you
know Summers tend to
be boring or bad and we may Trend down
this summer and then we have a terrific
you know fall and winter leading into
2025 so he's not alone in that thinking
a lot of people think that that
too however based on what has happened
in the last few weeks I think it's more
than that you could just see like boom a
huge cell volume come in out of
nowhere that is from someone some entity
that has a ton of Bitcoin to sell
right I don't know I'll keep looking let
you guys know where it's coming from but
I'm going back to basically two Sunday
walk
videos uh before in terms of what I
think is going to happen and two videos
ago basically I said hey we either go
straddle the 637 Mark which is a
support/resistance and right now it is a
resistance we're either go straddle that
for a few
months until Bitcoin is ready to move up
or we could Trend downwards to 52
and you know I filmed that when I
believe Bitcoin was around 56 57 right
and then we quickly went up to about 63
64 we hovered there for a week or so
then we started trending downwards now
to where we are about 61 62 right so
we're certainly not far off from that
637 Mark we can certainly go up there
within a day within hours in fact we go
right back up there this
week but if we don't and we continue to
see massive cells from this one
entity then maybe we do go down we Trend
downwards back to 52 and that's when we
Skyrocket upwards right so for myself
I'm trying to prepare for both scenarios
scenario number one if we just Trend
around
637 nothing changes
continue to do what I'm doing there's
really nothing else but to prepare for
scenario number
two really it's the same but I would
say I'm trying to get a little bit more
cash ready I think that's the only
difference because if we do Trend down
to 52 I think it'll be a terrific
terrific buying opportunity obviously a
great time to be
DC but if it happens you know that's
what I'm doing but but if it doesn't
happen and we don't do that well it's
okay to have a little bit more cash
right so I guess that's the only thing
the only strategy for me is to kind of
build up a little bit more cash just in
case just in case but really nothing
else changes and most of you guys
watching you have your DCA
schedule already in place so it doesn't
really matter I know it does and it
doesn't I'm I'm not trying
to I guess um downplay if Bitcoin goes
down to 52 because I know it'll suck
it's going to suck a lot alts are going
to drain
out a lot memes are going to drain out a
lot if that happens right so I'm not
trying to downplay if that happens but
on a grand scheme of things we have seen
nasty drops like that in previous cycles
and history tells us when we take
advantage and actually buy those points
those nasty drop
points we either Buy Low or
DCA they have returned great re great
gains afterwards right just you guys
know a lot of you guys watch me and I'm
shown enough times where there are many
times in a cycle where we see 20 25 30
35% drops had you dco DCA during those
low
points well you you would have made a
ton on the way up right so if we do
actually fall down to 52 I think it will
be one of those opportunities right so
for me just trying to get ready build a
bigger cash pile that's really it and of
course I'm will continue to keep
searching to see if I can find out who
it is maybe this entity you know kind of
like grce scale once they stop they stop
selling the cell pressure goes away and
then we can recover and just kind of go
sideways right but this last week
definitely we saw someone that kept
pushing and pushing and pushing but you
know despite that we are still higher
then a couple weeks ago when we fell
down to 56 right we are still above 60s
so we haven't retested down below 60 yet
so not
All Is Lost I guess
there's still a really good chance that
we can turn right back around so don't
be too discouraged guys but one thing I
did
learn from Noah yesterday during our
stream
is it's not time to go heavy into alt
and I agree with that he was looking at
from the perspective of eth versus
Bitcoin
dominance I don't know if I trust that
completely because eth has been really
underperforming this
cycle but have seen charts about altcoin
dominance Bitcoin dominance
and yeah it's not flipping to altcoin
dominance right now Bitcoin dominance is
still strong we're not seeing a surge in
allcoin dominance so I definitely don't
think this is a time to be flipping
heavy into alts if you have been dcing
that's fine but if we do fall back down
to 52 the alts will drain a lot more
than Bitcoin I'll guarantee you that it
happens every single dip so if we drop
top 10K for Bitcoin expect all
your favor alts to drop in a drastic way
and again if you're a long-term investor
and long-term holder you should be Sal
salivating because it's like going back
in time and being able to buy your
favorite alts at a discounted price
right but if you're not a long-term or
seasoned investor just know that it's
normal Don't Be Afraid continue to learn
and educate yourself about Cycles about
our macro environment about the
fundamentals about promising
Tech all of these
things and you'll see the right move is
to stay in the game continue to hold all
and DCA along the way that's really it
that's really it all right so that
that's my two cents about everything do
I have anything
else not really this last week I did see
alt's pretty much uh Al's getting a
little bit weaker I think that's to be
expected
memes I'd say memes kind of held well at
least the ones I'm looking at they
didn't get much weaker they did get a
little bit weaker but no weaker than say
the alts did and there are still some
mees are still doing well but like right
now obviously everything is moving with
Bitcoin as it always has and that's why
I've always suggested the 5025 25
rule it's never a bad idea to go 50%
Bitcoin for that stability and strength
and then 25% in big caps for some growth
and some stability and 25% in mid low
small caps and like caps for that hyper
growth but during
weakness you know that
25% a mid small micro cap can can hurt
that's why you're limited 25% you're not
going to 50 or 75% because then it'll
really discourage you
right that's about it I don't know
really nothing else going on I'm going
to enjoy this walk I'm going to finish
it up I'm just looking at the screen
right now how beautiful it is
outside you could see the the the
beautiful sky and the green all around
me I'm going to go enjoy this walk I'm
going to finish it up and I'll see you
guys
